            NepalEdu Map is a dedicated platform designed to bring visibility to the education sector in Nepal by identifying and 
            mapping unreached schools across the country. We believe education is a fundamental right, and our mission is to ensure
             that no school or community is left behind.

          <h3 style="color: #3E5879">Why EduMap Nepal?</h3>
          <p style="color: #3E5879"> Despite Nepal's significant strides in education, thousands of schools in remote areas still lack access to basic resources 
            such as qualified teachers, infrastructure, and learning materials. Many of these schools remain undocumented, making it 
            challenging to allocate aid and assistance effectively.</p>

          <h3 style="color: #3E5879">What We Do?</h3>
          <p style="color: #3E5879">  We use geographic data and on-the-ground information to map schools in the most remote and hard-to-reach areas of Nepal. 
            Each school is pinned on our digital map, providing critical data like location, accessibility, facilities, and needs.
            We collect and analyze data to identify gaps in educational access and resources.</p>
